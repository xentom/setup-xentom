# The `dist/setup/index.js` file is crucial for GitHub Actions.
# When an action is referenced using `uses:` in a workflow, the `index.js` file is the one that gets executed.
# In our project, this file is generated as part of the build process from various source files.
# Therefore, it's important to ensure that the committed `index.js` matches the expected output from the build.
